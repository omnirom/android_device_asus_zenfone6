# This file is the build configuration for a full Android
# build for grouper hardware. This cleanly combines a set of
# device-specific aspects (drivers) with a device-agnostic
# product configuration (apps).
#

# Sample: This is where we'd set a backup provider if we had one
# $(call inherit-product, device/sample/products/backup_overlay.mk)
$(call inherit-product, $(SRC_TARGET_DIR)/product/core_64_bit.mk)

# Get the prebuilt list of APNs
$(call inherit-product, vendor/omni/config/gsm.mk)

# Inherit from the common Open Source product configuration
$(call inherit-product, $(SRC_TARGET_DIR)/product/aosp_base_telephony.mk)

# must be before including omni part
TARGET_BOOTANIMATION_SIZE := 1080p

# Inherit from our custom product configuration
$(call inherit-product, vendor/omni/config/common.mk)

# Inherit from hardware-specific part of the product configuration
$(call inherit-product, device/asus/zenfone6/device.mk)

# Discard inherited values and use our own instead.
